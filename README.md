  <strong>A simple home teleportation plugin for Spigot/Bukkit that doesn't require heel-clicking.</strong>
</p>

## Description
Dorothy is a Spigot/Bukkit plugin for Minecraft servers that allows people with the right permissions to set a personal home that they can teleport to. Dorothy is very lightweight, simple, and prevents player suffocation by loading the respective chunk before teleporting the player.

## Download
You can download the latest Dorothy JAR file under the [Releases](https://github.com/adamgrieger/Dorothy/releases) tab. Make sure you don't accidentally download the compressed source code, because it is not compiled for you!
